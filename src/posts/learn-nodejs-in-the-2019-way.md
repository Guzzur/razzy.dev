# Learn Node.js in the 2019 way

So, I'm starting my TIL (Today I Learned) series. I hope to keep writing down stuff I'm learning and want you guys to know if you didn't.

The first subject will going to be learning Javascript and Node.js from scratch.

I wrote my first line of Javascript code only a few years ago. I made my own research on what is the best sequence to get into coding in JS and which sources to use. Hope the list below will help you somehow if you are about to make the same way I did.

You are about to read totally unbiased (and not sponsored, unfortunatelly) opinion I have on JS and Node online course and knowledge sources.

Assuming you have node runtime, npm and vs code (or any other editor you like) installed, lets grab few sources that are going to make you a pro-grammer you want to be.

## Nodeschool.io

Lets start with **https://nodeschool.io**, one of the best hands-on courses I found.

Their `javascripting` tool/course is so cool, it worth trying even if you are a pro in JS.

Just `npm install -g javascripting && javascripting` and you are good to go

## Traversy Media

## Fire something school

## Doing sh*t

Actually, the best way to get started coding is... you won't believe... to start coding.

If you don't have an idea what to do first as a starter project, choose something from the list below. There are a lot of To Do apps and kittens galleries. **Please**, create something you or someone else needs.

### Make yourself a CV / portfolio website

### Make some tool someone you care about needs

### Create a page about something you passionate about
